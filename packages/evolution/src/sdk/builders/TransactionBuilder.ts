/**
 * Transaction builder storing a sequence of deferred operations that assemble and balance a transaction.
 *
 * @module TransactionBuilder
 * @since 2.0.0
 *
 * ## Execution Model
 *
 * The builder pattern:
 * - **Immutable configuration** at construction (protocol params, change address, available UTxOs)
 * - **ProgramSteps array** accumulates deferred effects via chainable API methods
 * - **Fresh state per build()** — each execution creates new Ref instances, runs all programs sequentially
 * - **Deferred composition** — no I/O or state updates occur until build() is invoked
 *
 * Key invariant: calling `build()` twice with the same builder instance produces two independent results
 * with no cross-contamination because fresh state (Refs) is created each time.
 *
 * ## Coin Selection
 *
 * Automatic coin selection selects UTxOs from `availableUtxos` to satisfy transaction outputs and fees.
 * The `collectFrom()` method allows manual input selection; automatic selection excludes these to prevent
 * double-spending. UTxOs can come from any source (wallet, DeFi protocols, other participants, etc.).

// Transaction Builder Interface - Hybrid Effect/Promise API
// ============================================================================

/**
 * TransactionBuilder with hybrid Effect/Promise API following lucid-evolution pattern.
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - Immutable builder instance stores array of ProgramSteps
 * - Chainable methods create ProgramSteps and return same builder instance
 * - Completion methods (build, chain, etc.) execute all stored ProgramSteps with FRESH state
 * - Builder can be reused - each build() call is independent with its own state
 *
 * Key Design Principle:
 * Builder instance never mutates. Programs are deferred Effects that execute later.
 * Each build() creates fresh TxBuilderState, executes programs, returns result.
 *
 * Generic Type Parameter:
 * TResult determines the return type of build() methods:
 * - SignBuilder: When wallet has signing capability (SigningClient)
 * - TransactionResultBase: When wallet is read-only (ReadOnlyClient)
 *
 * Usage Pattern:
 * ```typescript
 * const builder = makeTxBuilder(provider, params, costModels, utxos)
 *   .payToAddress({ address: "addr1...", assets: { lovelace: 5_000_000n } })
 *   .collectFrom({ inputs: [utxo1, utxo2] })
 *
 * // First build - creates fresh state, executes programs
 * const signBuilder1 = await builder.build()
 *
 * // Second build - NEW fresh state, independent execution
 * const signBuilder2 = await builder.build()
 * ```
 *
 * @typeParam TResult - The result type returned by build methods (SignBuilder or TransactionResultBase)
